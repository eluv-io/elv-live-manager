  localizations: |
    Select the languages / locales you would like the site to be available in.

    If any localizations are specified, you can set values for localizable fields by selecting a localization from the select box in the top right corner.

    If a localized value is not set it will use the default value for that field, so you only need to specify the fields you would like to override from their default value.
